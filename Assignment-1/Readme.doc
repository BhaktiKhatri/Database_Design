Assignment 
Write a scaled-back contact manager program.  Ideally, your program would have table-maintenance dialogs for every actual data table other than those linked to the contact itself.  Since that isnâ€™t practical, create a screen that lets you add, change, and delete contacts.  The purpose of this assignment is for you to learn how to interface to a database from within a program.
Add, change, and delete can work with a limited set of tables, although obviously if someone adds complete contact information, include an address, multiple phone numbers, multiple e-mail addresses, and so on, this could end up affecting multiple tables.  Keep your program as simple as possible while meeting the criteria.  Stored procedures will help greatly.
Always maintain referential integrity both at the database level and at the level of your program; that is, only allow delete of a secondary table item if there are no references to it.  Here is a sample screen for this, using the Company database from the text.  Obviously you should use your own database.
